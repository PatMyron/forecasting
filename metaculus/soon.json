Biya has been President of Cameroon since 1982, when the country's first president resigned and Biya, then prime minister, ascended to the office. In the decades since, Biya has regularly won reelection, in 1984, 1988, 1992, 1997, 2004, 2011, and 2018. (In 2008, the national assembly removed the term-limits provision from the constitution so he could continue to run.) The closest of these elections was in [1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Cameroonian_presidential_election), when Biya won with only 40% of the vote, not too far ahead of the second-place finisher, who attracted 36% of the vote. Since then, Biya has regularly trounced his opposition, amid allegations of fraud or electoral boycotts by opposing parties.\n\nBiya is again standing for reelection in October 2025. [Polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Cameroonian_presidential_election#Opinion_polls) in the months leading up to the election indicated that Biya was running third, slightly behind [Cabral Libii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabral_Libii) and far behind [Maurice Kamto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Kamto). On July 26, 2025, however, Kamto was [disqualified](https://www.hilltopvoices.com/2025/07/elecam-publishes-official-list-of-13.html) by the state electoral authority. [More recent polling](https://cameroonnewsagency.com/breaking-news-cna-poll-makes-startling-revelations-on-upcoming-presidential-election/) indicates overwhelming opposition to Biya's remaining in office but no clear coalescence around an opposition candidate. Biya faces several opponents in the race and needs only a plurality of votes to win.",

The purpose is not really to learn about UFOs (although feel free to do that too!), but instead to learn to watch the pace of event occurrences and their trajectory and gain an intuition about doing that type of forecast.* &#x20;\n\nNewsNation: [Over 2K UFO sightings reported in first half of 2025](https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/2000-ufo-sightings-first-half-2025/)\n\n> There have been [more than 2,000 sightings of UFOs](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) in the first half of 2025, according to data from the National UFO Reporting Center, or NUFORC.\n\n> The nonprofit organization collects reports of UFOs and investigates cases of unexplained sightings. The 2,174 sightings are an increase from previous years. In 2024, the agency logged 1,492 sightings between the beginning of January and the end of June, and in 2023, 2,077 were recorded in the same time frame.\n\n...\n\n> Those numbers likely only represent a small number of actual sightings, said Christian Stepien, the group‚Äôs chief technology officer. Based on anecdotal evidence, he believes roughly 5% of sightings get reported.\n\n> The group takes reports from everyday citizens as well as air traffic controllers, police and members of the military.\n\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/):\n\n> The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center‚Äôs primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.",

    "description": "*This is a Metaculus Learning Academy question. The purpose is not really to learn about UFOs (although feel free to do that too!), but instead to learn to watch the pace of event occurrences and their trajectory and gain an intuition about doing that type of forecast.* &#x20;\n\nNewsNation: [Over 2K UFO sightings reported in first half of 2025](https://www.newsnationnow.com/space/ufo/2000-ufo-sightings-first-half-2025/)\n\n> There have been [more than 2,000 sightings of UFOs](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) in the first half of 2025, according to data from the National UFO Reporting Center, or NUFORC.\n\n> The nonprofit organization collects reports of UFOs and investigates cases of unexplained sightings. The 2,174 sightings are an increase from previous years. In 2024, the agency logged 1,492 sightings between the beginning of January and the end of June, and in 2023, 2,077 were recorded in the same time frame.\n\n...\n\n> Those numbers likely only represent a small number of actual sightings, said Christian Stepien, the group‚Äôs chief technology officer. Based on anecdotal evidence, he believes roughly 5% of sightings get reported.\n\n> The group takes reports from everyday citizens as well as air traffic controllers, police and members of the military.\n\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/):\n\n> The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center‚Äôs primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals."

Over the next three days, the stock price plunged from \\$60.87 to a low of \\$50.27 on August 21, which was a decline of 17%. From there, the stock rallied to \\$54.80 at the end of the day, up 9% from the low.&#x20;\r\n\r\n<img height=\"266\" width=\"472\" src=\"https://metaculus-web-media.s3.amazonaws.com/user_uploaded/Screenshot_2025-08-21_at_7.28.56PM.png\" />Cracker Barrel's CEO, Julie Felss Masino, [said](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/food/story/cracker-barrel-ceo-announces-campaign-jordan-davis-hints-124769888) regarding the rebranding and other restaurant redesigns and changes, \"The buzz is so good, not only from our customers, but from our team,\" adding that the feedback had been \"overwhelmingly positive.\"&#x20;\r\n\r\nAccording to [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/21/food/cracker-barrel-new-logo), however: &#x20;\r\n\r\n> Cracker Barrel risks confusing its customers with a rebrand, especially with its recognizable logo and decor, according to Anjali Bal, associate professor of marketing at Babson College.\r\n\r\n> ‚ÄúThis risk is amplified if the company misjudges the market or fails to communicate the change effectively,‚Äù she told CNN. ‚ÄúIn Cracker Barrel‚Äôs case, they‚Äôve retained their color palette but altered their iconic logo, which is likely to face resistance simply because of how recognizable it is. That could spark curiosity among new customers, but it may also upset long-time patrons.‚Äù\r\n\r\n> Bal added that the updated logo makes Cracker Barrel ‚Äústand out less and risks diluting the brand‚Äôs uniqueness,‚Äù but the ‚Äúchallenge is ensuring that modernization doesn‚Äôt come at the expense of brand recognition or emotional connection.‚Äù\r\n\r\nIn past quarters, Cracker Barrel's quarterly revenues have been:&#x20;\r\n\r\n| Period  | Revenues in millions    | YoY growth |\r\n| ------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |\r\n| Q1 2023 | 839.5                   |            |\r\n| Q2 2023 | 933.9                   |            |\r\n| Q3 2023 | 832.7                   |            |\r\n| Q4 2023 | 836.7                   |            |\r\n| Q1 2024 | 823.8                   | -1.87%     |\r\n| Q2 2024 | 935.4                   | 0.16%      |\r\n| Q3 2024 | 817.1                   | -1.87%     |\r\n| Q4 2024 | 894.4                   | 6.90%      |\r\n| Q1 2025 | 845.1                   | 2.59%      |\r\n| Q2 2025 | 949.4                   | 1.50%      |\r\n| Q3 2025 | 821.1                   | 0.49%      |\r\n| Q4 2025 | Expected Sept 23, 2025  |            |\r\n| Q1 2026 | Expected early Dec 2025 |            |\r\n\r\nThis is a Metaculus Learning Academy question, where you are encouraged to post your forecasting rationale and give and receive constructive feedback.

From there, the stock rallied to \\$54.80 at the end of the day, up 9% from the low.&#x20;\r\n\r\n<img height=\"266\" width=\"472\" src=\"https://metaculus-web-media.s3.amazonaws.com/user_uploaded/Screenshot_2025-08-21_at_7.28.56PM.png\" />Cracker Barrel's CEO, Julie Felss Masino, [said](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/food/story/cracker-barrel-ceo-announces-campaign-jordan-davis-hints-124769888) regarding the rebranding and other restaurant redesigns and changes, \"The buzz is so good, not only from our customers, but from our team,\" adding that the feedback had been \"overwhelmingly positive.\"&#x20;\r\n\r\nAccording to [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/21/food/cracker-barrel-new-logo), however: &#x20;\r\n\r\n> Cracker Barrel risks confusing its customers with a rebrand, especially with its recognizable logo and decor, according to Anjali Bal, associate professor of marketing at Babson College.\r\n\r\n> ‚ÄúThis risk is amplified if the company misjudges the market or fails to communicate the change effectively,‚Äù she told CNN. ‚ÄúIn Cracker Barrel‚Äôs case, they‚Äôve retained their color palette but altered their iconic logo, which is likely to face resistance simply because of how recognizable it is. That could spark curiosity among new customers, but it may also upset long-time patrons.‚Äù\r\n\r\n> Bal added that the updated logo makes Cracker Barrel ‚Äústand out less and risks diluting the brand‚Äôs uniqueness,‚Äù but the ‚Äúchallenge is ensuring that modernization doesn‚Äôt come at the expense of brand recognition or emotional connection.‚Äù\r\n\r\nIn past quarters, Cracker Barrel's quarterly revenues have been:&#x20;\r\n\r\n| Period  | Revenues in millions    | YoY growth |\r\n| ------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |\r\n| Q1 2023 | 839.5                   |            |\r\n| Q2 2023 | 933.9                   |            |\r\n| Q3 2023 | 832.7                   |            |\r\n| Q4 2023 | 836.7                   |            |\r\n| Q1 2024 | 823.8                   | -1.87%     |\r\n| Q2 2024 | 935.4                   | 0.16%      |\r\n| Q3 2024 | 817.1                   | -1.87%     |\r\n| Q4 2024 | 894.4                   | 6.90%      |\r\n| Q1 2025 | 845.1                   | 2.59%      |\r\n| Q2 2025 | 949.4                   | 1.50%      |\r\n| Q3 2025 | 821.1                   | 0.49%      |\r\n| Q4 2025 | Expected Sept 23, 2025  |            |\r\n| Q1 2026 | Expected early Dec 2025 |            |\r\n\r\nThis is a Metaculus Learning Academy question, where you are encouraged to post your forecasting rationale and give and receive constructive feedback.

The purpose is to improve your forecasting skills.*\n\nAt the time of this question, Zohran Mamdani, as the official candidate of the Democratic Party,  is on a trajectory to win the [blue](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/new-york-city/new-york-city-2024-election-vote-totals/5959798/) city of New York. He leads the [polling averages](https://www.racetothewh.com/nycmayorpolling) with 38.5% of the vote, as compared with 24.6% for former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and 10.9% for Mayor Eric Adams. The fourth major candidate, Republican Curtis Sliwa, is at 14.8% in the polling averages. Ideologically, Mamdani is a progressive leftist, while Cuomo and Adams are positioned more toward the center. Thus Mamdani, although he has significantly under 50% of the vote, has a comfortable lead against a divided field.&#x20;\n\nThis divided field has led to calls, including among the candidates themselves, for someone to drop out. According to [Politico](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-york-playbook/2025/08/05/cuomo-and-adams-wont-get-out-of-each-others-way-00493471):&#x20;\n\n> You‚Äôd be hard pressed to find a collection of New Yorkers who are more stubborn than Andrew Cuomo, Eric Adams and Curtis Sliwa,‚Äù said Democratic strategist Trip Yang. ‚ÄúThe only shot that the anti-Mamdani forces have of stopping the Democratic nominee in a heavily Democratic city is to consolidate. The chances of that happening are slim to none.‚Äù\n\nMost polls ([example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TggWOuou2l51baFzG48GhTdRacSh0YbQyWu8Vjs0lH4/edit?slide=id.g3718dd780c5_1_87#slide=id.g3718dd780c5_1_87)) find that in the event of one of the non-Mamdani candidates dropping out, most of their support gets distributed to the remaining field rather than to Mamdani, which thus reduces Mamdani's lead.",

Therefore, this area will be&nbsp;**<u>closed</u>**&nbsp;to traffic during the week of&nbsp;**<u>May 12</u>**&nbsp;due to ongoing construction work.&nbsp; During this time, PCC will replace the sewer and water infrastructure and update the road base as they proceed, ensuring the roadway can be reopened and available for resident use once a section is complete. PCC anticipates reopening the area by May 19, or sooner if possible. We kindly request that residents make alternate parking arrangements until they can reaccess their driveways.&nbsp; We appreciate your continued patience and cooperation as we work to improve the community‚Äôs infrastructure.

    "description": "In October 2024, Gulf Breeze began replacing old water and sewer systems in the Baybridge neighborhood near the Pensacola Bay Bridge. The work includes digging up and replacing water mains and sewer lines in both homes and businesses throughout the area. The project is currently scheduled to be finished by October 16, 2025.\n\nFrom the city project latest status update:\n\n> 5.7.25:&nbsp;**Notice of Construction ‚Äì Road Closure ‚Äì Buildings 104-118**&nbsp;Pensacola Concrete Construction (PCC) has informed the City that they will begin construction on the east side of the property, beginning approximately at the pool area and extending to Building 118. Therefore, this area will be&nbsp;**<u>closed</u>**&nbsp;to traffic during the week of&nbsp;**<u>May 12</u>**&nbsp;due to ongoing construction work.&nbsp; During this time, PCC will replace the sewer and water infrastructure and update the road base as they proceed, ensuring the roadway can be reopened and available for resident use once a section is complete. PCC anticipates reopening the area by May 19, or sooner if possible. We kindly request that residents make alternate parking arrangements until they can reaccess their driveways.&nbsp; We appreciate your continued patience and cooperation as we work to improve the community‚Äôs infrastructure. If you have any questions or concerns, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out.\n\nThis forecast asks: will the main construction work be done by the start of November 2025?\n\n## City of Gulf Breeze Baybridge Water and Sewer Replacement Project Resources\n\n* **Baybridge Water & Sewer Replacement - City of Gulf Breeze**\n  [https://cityofgulfbreeze.us/city\\_project/baybridge-water-sewer-replacement/](https://cityofgulfbreeze.us/city_project/baybridge-water-sewer-replacement/)\n  *Project page with detailed construction updates through 2025, including phases completed, road closures, testing, and contractor progress.

A democratic socialist is getting a boost in Minnesota.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/is-a-mamdani-repeat-coming-to-the-midwest-a-democratic-socialist-is-getting-a-boost-in-minnesota/ar-AA1JcfEP)\n\n> The Democratic Party in Minneapolis over the weekend endorsed a democratic socialist over the two-term incumbent in the city‚Äôs mayoral race, the latest indicator of increased momentum for the progressive left in local races across the country.\n\n> Delegates of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party of Minnesota‚Äôs most populous city on Saturday threw their support behind state Sen. Omar Fateh, who defeated Mayor Jacob Frey, at the party‚Äôs convention. The endorsement comes less than a month after Zohran Mamdani, also a democratic socialist and state lawmaker, won the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York.\n\n> The mayoral race is a ranked-choice election, like in New York, and the general election will take place in November when all candidates will compete on the same ballot regardless of party affiliation. A Democrat is expected to win the race, as Minneapolis is a heavily Democratic city that has been led by Democratic mayors for more than 47 years.\n\n> While several candidates are running, the DFL endorsement effectively pits a democratic socialist against a relatively more moderate Frey. The mayoral race is far from over, according to political observers ‚Äî but the endorsement does boost Fateh‚Äôs profile. It also represents a major win for liberals, and is likely to draw national attention and money on the race.\n\nSince the turn of the 21st Century, incumbent mayors of Minneapolis have been re-elected 60% of the time: in 2021, 2009, 2005. Conversely, they have lost 40% of the time: in 2017 (to the current mayor, Jacob Frey) and in 2001.&#x20;\n\nAt the time of this question, there has been little public polling in the race. A poll from May 2025 [found](https://www.mplsforthemany.com/polling) Mayor Frey with -21% net favorability, which is 20 points worse than in September 2021, when Frey won the final round by 12.5 points against a progressive field that was divided into two main contenders, as compared with one (Fateh) in the 2025 election.&#x20;\n\nMayor Frey is also appealing his loss of the¬†Minneapolis Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party‚Äôs endorsement, according to [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5412323-minneapolis-mayor-frey-appeal-endorsement/).&#x20;",

    "description": "Washington Post (July 24, 2025): [Is a Mamdani repeat coming to the Midwest? A democratic socialist is getting a boost in Minnesota.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/is-a-mamdani-repeat-coming-to-the-midwest-a-democratic-socialist-is-getting-a-boost-in-minnesota/ar-AA1JcfEP)\n\n> The Democratic Party in Minneapolis over the weekend endorsed a democratic socialist over the two-term incumbent in the city‚Äôs mayoral race, the latest indicator of increased momentum for the progressive left in local races across the country.\n\n> Delegates of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party of Minnesota‚Äôs most populous city on Saturday threw their support behind state Sen. Omar Fateh, who defeated Mayor Jacob Frey, at the party‚Äôs convention. The endorsement comes less than a month after Zohran Mamdani, also a democratic socialist and state lawmaker, won the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York.\n\n> The mayoral race is a ranked-choice election, like in New York, and the general election will take place in November when all candidates will compete on the same ballot regardless of party affiliation. A Democrat is expected to win the race, as Minneapolis is a heavily Democratic city that has been led by Democratic mayors for more than 47 years.\n\n> While several candidates are running, the DFL endorsement effectively pits a democratic socialist against a relatively more moderate Frey. The mayoral race is far from over, according to political observers ‚Äî but the endorsement does boost Fateh‚Äôs profile. It also represents a major win for liberals, and is likely to draw national attention and money on the race.\n\nSince the turn of the 21st Century, incumbent mayors of Minneapolis have been re-elected 60% of the time: in 2021, 2009, 2005. Conversely, they have lost 40% of the time: in 2017 (to the current mayor, Jacob Frey) and in 2001.&#x20;\n\nAt the time of this question, there has been little public polling in the race. A poll from May 2025 [found](https://www.mplsforthemany.com/polling) Mayor Frey with -21% net favorability, which is 20 points worse than in September 2021, when Frey won the final round by 12.5 points against a progressive field that was divided into two main contenders, as compared with one (Fateh) in the 2025 election.&#x20;\n\nMayor Frey is also appealing his loss of the¬†Minneapolis Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party‚Äôs endorsement, according to [The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5412323-minneapolis-mayor-frey-appeal-endorsement/).&#x20;"

      "description": "According to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-28/electric-cars-pass-adoption-tipping-point-in-31-countries?srnd=green), once 5% of new car sales are fully electric, it can be a pivotal tipping point, signaling the start of mass adoption of a new technology:\n\n> New technologies ‚Äî from televisions to smartwatches ‚Äî follow an S-shaped adoption curve. Sales move at a crawl during the early-adopter phase, before hooking into a wave of mainstream acceptance. The transition often hinges on overcoming initial barriers such as cost, a lack of infrastructure and consumer skepticism. The tipping point signals the flattening of these barriers. While each country‚Äôs journey to 5% plays out differently, timelines converge in the years that follow.\n\n> ‚ÄúOnce enough sales occur, you kind of have a virtuous cycle,‚Äù said Corey Cantor, an EV analyst at BloombergNEF. ‚ÄúMore EVs popping up means more people seeing them as mainstream, automakers more willing to invest in the market, and the charging infrastructure expanding on a good trajectory.\n\nMarket shares in other countries have been as follows:\n\n| Country     | EV sales in Q4 2023 | EV market shr Q4 '24 (%) | First quarter at 5% tipping point |\n| ----------- | ------------------: | -----------------------: | --------------------------------: |\n| Norway      |              25,028 |                     79.6 |                           2013 Q3 |\n| Iceland     |               3,507 |                     58.4 |                           2019 Q1 |\n| Denmark     |              21,890 |                     44.9 |                           2020 Q3 |\n| Sweden      |              31,780 |                     39.8 |                           2020 Q1 |\n| Finland     |               6,686 |                     35.3 |                           2020 Q4 |\n| Netherlands |              29,199 |                     35.1 |                           2018 Q4 |\n| Ireland     |               1,164 |                     33.9 |                           2019 Q4 |\n| Belgium     |              25,752 |                     25.3 |                           2021 Q3 |\n| Portugal    |              11,265 |                     24.3 |                           2020 Q4 |\n| Switzerland |              16,581 |                     23.9 |                           2020 Q1 |\n| China       |           1,879,600 |                     23.8 |                           2020 Q4 |\n| Austria     |              13,083 |                     23.3 |                           2020 Q3 |\n| Israel      |               6,772 |                     22.9 |                           2021 Q3 |\n| France      |              98,755 |                     20.3 |                           2020 Q1 |\n| New Zealand |               7,435 |                     20.0 |                           2021 Q3 |\n| Germany     |             138,390 |                     19.6 |                           2020 Q3 |\n| UK          |              79,602 |                     17.6 |                           2020 Q2 |\n| Thailand    |              23,864 |                     12.6 |                           2023 Q1 |\n| Turkey      |              36,026 |                     12.0 |                           2023 Q3 |\n| Romania     |               3,655 |                     10.8 |                           2021 Q4 |\n| Slovenia    |               1,126 |                     10.7 |                           2022 Q4 |\n| Australia   |              21,571 |                      9.5 |                           2022 Q3 |\n| Canada      |              38,160 |                      9.4 |                           2022 Q1 |\n| Spain       |              20,666 |                      8.7 |                           2022 Q4 |\n| US          |             313,822 |                      8.1 |                           2021 Q4 |\n| Estonia     |                 400 |                      7.5 |                           2023 Q2 |\n| South Korea |              36,009 |                      6.9 |                           2021 Q3 |\n| Hungary     |               1,614 |                      6.5 |                           2022 Q4 |\n| Bulgaria    |                 551 |                      5.8 |                           2023 Q4 |\n| Italy       |              21,033 |                      5.4 |                           2023 Q4 |\n| Greece      |               1,579 |                      5.3 |                           2023 Q2 |\n\nArgonne National Laboratory tracks monthly electric vehicle sales figures in its [Light Duty Electric Drive Vehicles Monthly Sales Updates](https://www.anl.gov/esia/light-duty-electric-drive-vehicles-monthly-sales-updates).\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

    "description": "According to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-28/electric-cars-pass-adoption-tipping-point-in-31-countries?srnd=green), once 5% of new car sales are fully electric, it can be a pivotal tipping point, signaling the start of mass adoption of a new technology:\n\n> New technologies ‚Äî from televisions to smartwatches ‚Äî follow an S-shaped adoption curve. Sales move at a crawl during the early-adopter phase, before hooking into a wave of mainstream acceptance. The transition often hinges on overcoming initial barriers such as cost, a lack of infrastructure and consumer skepticism. The tipping point signals the flattening of these barriers. While each country‚Äôs journey to 5% plays out differently, timelines converge in the years that follow.\n\n> ‚ÄúOnce enough sales occur, you kind of have a virtuous cycle,‚Äù said Corey Cantor, an EV analyst at BloombergNEF. ‚ÄúMore EVs popping up means more people seeing them as mainstream, automakers more willing to invest in the market, and the charging infrastructure expanding on a good trajectory.\n\nMarket shares in other countries have been as follows:\n\n| Country     | EV sales in Q4 2023 | EV market shr Q4 '24 (%) | First quarter at 5% tipping point |\n| ----------- | ------------------: | -----------------------: | --------------------------------: |\n| Norway      |              25,028 |                     79.6 |                           2013 Q3 |\n| Iceland     |               3,507 |                     58.4 |                           2019 Q1 |\n| Denmark     |              21,890 |                     44.9 |                           2020 Q3 |\n| Sweden      |              31,780 |                     39.8 |                           2020 Q1 |\n| Finland     |               6,686 |                     35.3 |                           2020 Q4 |\n| Netherlands |              29,199 |                     35.1 |                           2018 Q4 |\n| Ireland     |               1,164 |                     33.9 |                           2019 Q4 |\n| Belgium     |              25,752 |                     25.3 |                           2021 Q3 |\n| Portugal    |              11,265 |                     24.3 |                           2020 Q4 |\n| Switzerland |              16,581 |                     23.9 |                           2020 Q1 |\n| China       |           1,879,600 |                     23.8 |                           2020 Q4 |\n| Austria     |              13,083 |                     23.3 |                           2020 Q3 |\n| Israel      |               6,772 |                     22.9 |                           2021 Q3 |\n| France      |              98,755 |                     20.3 |                           2020 Q1 |\n| New Zealand |               7,435 |                     20.0 |                           2021 Q3 |\n| Germany     |             138,390 |                     19.6 |                           2020 Q3 |\n| UK          |              79,602 |                     17.6 |                           2020 Q2 |\n| Thailand    |              23,864 |                     12.6 |                           2023 Q1 |\n| Turkey      |              36,026 |                     12.0 |                           2023 Q3 |\n| Romania     |               3,655 |                     10.8 |                           2021 Q4 |\n| Slovenia    |               1,126 |                     10.7 |                           2022 Q4 |\n| Australia   |              21,571 |                      9.5 |                           2022 Q3 |\n| Canada      |              38,160 |                      9.4 |                           2022 Q1 |\n| Spain       |              20,666 |                      8.7 |                           2022 Q4 |\n| US          |             313,822 |                      8.1 |                           2021 Q4 |\n| Estonia     |                 400 |                      7.5 |                           2023 Q2 |\n| South Korea |              36,009 |                      6.9 |                           2021 Q3 |\n| Hungary     |               1,614 |                      6.5 |                           2022 Q4 |\n| Bulgaria    |                 551 |                      5.8 |                           2023 Q4 |\n| Italy       |              21,033 |                      5.4 |                           2023 Q4 |\n| Greece      |               1,579 |                      5.3 |                           2023 Q2 |\n\nArgonne National Laboratory tracks monthly electric vehicle sales figures in its [Light Duty Electric Drive Vehicles Monthly Sales Updates](https://www.anl.gov/esia/light-duty-electric-drive-vehicles-monthly-sales-updates).\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

      "description": "GiveWell has provided a [pilot grant](https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/evidence-action-india-ILC-pilot-expansion-july-2023) and a [scale-up grant](https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/evidence-action-in-line-chlorination-india-september-2023) to [Evidence Action](https://www.evidenceaction.org/programs/safe-water-now) to provide technical assistance to the Indian states of Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh in setting up [in-line chlorination](https://blog.givewell.org/2024/06/26/research-strategy-water/) (ILC) devices to [chlorinate](https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/evidence-action-in-line-chlorination-india-september-2023#We_think_ILC_devices) drinking water in rural populations, which GiveWell estimates is a highly cost-effective way to reduce the all-mortality rate among children under 5.\n\nA key measure of the success of the program is the chlorination rates in the target households of Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. For those served in the first two years of the 5-year program (September 2023 - September 2025), GiveWell expects that at least 65% of households will be using chlorinated water in September 2025. This is a measure of the proportion of households with positive free chlorine residual in household drinking water samples, which Evidence Action plans to collect as part of its routine monitoring.

      "description": "At present, there is only one EU-wide compulsory system of labelling on animal welfare, which applies to [table eggs](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM%3A4324376). It defines different production methods (0 = organic egg production 1 = free-range eggs 2 = deep litter indoor housing 3 = cage farming). There are also EU voluntary marketing standards for [poultry meat](https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/animals-and-animal-products/animal-products/poultry_en), which includes reference to types of farming.There are currently a dozen different labelling schemes on farm animal welfare in at least six European countries.\n\nIn its [Farm to Fork Strategy](https://ec.europa.eu/food/farm2fork_en) published in May 2020, the EU Commission referred to labelling as ‚Äúa central instrument to provide consumers high-quality information, regarding the sustainability level of food production, the nutritional value of food items, as well as consumer information related to animal welfare‚Äù. On 15 June 2020, the European Commission established, under the [EU Platform on Animal Welfare](https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/welfare/eu-platform-animal-welfare_en), a sub-group on animal welfare labelling. The sub-group will assist the Commission in collecting data on previous experiences on animal welfare labelling. The European Commission is going to start a [study on animal welfare labelling in 2021](https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/welfare/other_aspects/labelling_en), leading to a proposal following this. \n\nOn December 15 2020, the Council of the European Union on Agriculture and Fisheries adopted a [joint position](https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-13691-2020-INIT/en/pdf) that asks the European Commission to consider the development of a tiered transparent labelling scheme allowing for sufficient incentives for producers to improve animal welfare. \n\nIn a July 2020 [survey](https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/aw_platform_20201103_pres-01.pdf) of 25 of the 27 EU governments, only 15 prefer the implementation of an EU-wide animal welfare label through EU legislation.\n\nThe [Eurobarometer survey from 2015](https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/S2096_84_4_442_ENG) showed that 52% of European consumers look for labels that identify products from animal welfare-friendly production systems.",
      "resolution_criteria": "This will resolve positively if by the end of December 31st 2025 a mandatory EU animal welfare label is in force per credible media reporting or the [EC Press corner](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/).",
      "fine_print": "The label must be multi-level and clearly distinguish between higher and lower standards. It must be required on all products for at least chickens, pigs, and cows and include information about the entire process of the method of production (rearing, transport, slaughter) . A label similar to prospective labels such as [Haltungsform](https://www.haltungsform.de/) (Germany), Lidl UK‚Äôs [method-of-production labelling](https://corporate.lidl.co.uk/sustainability/animal-welfare/mop-labelling) for poultry meat and the [Etiquette bien-√™tre animal](http://www.etiquettebienetreanimal.fr/comprendre-letiquette/comment-lire-letiquette/) (France) can be used as a benchmark.",

    "description": "At present, there is only one EU-wide compulsory system of labelling on animal welfare, which applies to [table eggs](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM%3A4324376). It defines different production methods (0 = organic egg production 1 = free-range eggs 2 = deep litter indoor housing 3 = cage farming). There are also EU voluntary marketing standards for [poultry meat](https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/animals-and-animal-products/animal-products/poultry_en), which includes reference to types of farming.There are currently a dozen different labelling schemes on farm animal welfare in at least six European countries.\n\nIn its [Farm to Fork Strategy](https://ec.europa.eu/food/farm2fork_en) published in May 2020, the EU Commission referred to labelling as ‚Äúa central instrument to provide consumers high-quality information, regarding the sustainability level of food production, the nutritional value of food items, as well as consumer information related to animal welfare‚Äù. On 15 June 2020, the European Commission established, under the [EU Platform on Animal Welfare](https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/welfare/eu-platform-animal-welfare_en), a sub-group on animal welfare labelling. The sub-group will assist the Commission in collecting data on previous experiences on animal welfare labelling. The European Commission is going to start a [study on animal welfare labelling in 2021](https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/welfare/other_aspects/labelling_en), leading to a proposal following this. \n\nOn December 15 2020, the Council of the European Union on Agriculture and Fisheries adopted a [joint position](https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-13691-2020-INIT/en/pdf) that asks the European Commission to consider the development of a tiered transparent labelling scheme allowing for sufficient incentives for producers to improve animal welfare. \n\nIn a July 2020 [survey](https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/aw_platform_20201103_pres-01.pdf) of 25 of the 27 EU governments, only 15 prefer the implementation of an EU-wide animal welfare label through EU legislation.\n\nThe [Eurobarometer survey from 2015](https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/S2096_84_4_442_ENG) showed that 52% of European consumers look for labels that identify products from animal welfare-friendly production systems."

For instance, April 7, 2020, Gatestone Institute: [Coronavirus: The Looming Collapse of Europe's Single Currency](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/15856/coronavirus-euro-collapse) quotes:\n\n>Achim Truger, a member of the German Council of Economic Experts, said that he believes that coronabonds are necessary to prevent a collapse of the euro:\n\n> >\"All countries in Europe are being hit by the epidemic ‚Äî Italy and Spain particularly hard. All countries, including Germany, must therefore be able to make the necessary health expenditures and take measures to bridge the economic crisis. This is only possible through additional government debt, and this must be guaranteed to prevent another euro crisis. If the debt loads of Italy and Spain rise sharply, they will be pushed into budget cuts, thus economic, social and political crises, which would ultimately lead to a sovereign debt crisis and a collapse of the euro and the EU. Therefore, there must now be a joint, solidarity-based solution.\"",

    "description": "In response to the COVID-19 crisis, various EU-skeptics are talking about a possible collapse of [the Eurozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone). For instance, April 7, 2020, Gatestone Institute: [Coronavirus: The Looming Collapse of Europe's Single Currency](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/15856/coronavirus-euro-collapse) quotes:\n\n>Achim Truger, a member of the German Council of Economic Experts, said that he believes that coronabonds are necessary to prevent a collapse of the euro:\n\n> >\"All countries in Europe are being hit by the epidemic ‚Äî Italy and Spain particularly hard. All countries, including Germany, must therefore be able to make the necessary health expenditures and take measures to bridge the economic crisis. This is only possible through additional government debt, and this must be guaranteed to prevent another euro crisis. If the debt loads of Italy and Spain rise sharply, they will be pushed into budget cuts, thus economic, social and political crises, which would ultimately lead to a sovereign debt crisis and a collapse of the euro and the EU. Therefore, there must now be a joint, solidarity-based solution.\""
